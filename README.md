<b>React<b/> <i>is a declarative, efficient, flexible and open source JavaScript library for building user interfaces<i/>. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”. React came into existence in 2011, when Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook created the library. The first use case of React was in Facebook’s newsfeed in 2011. Later on, it is picked up by Instagram to use it in their system. With time, React grew, and Facebook decided to make it open source in May 2013 at JSConf US. 
<i>React can be used as a base in the development of <b>single-page<b/> or mobile applications.<i/>
